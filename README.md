This is a game/simulation, whose main purpose is to land the Falcon 9 rocket on a barge in the ocean.
It has three modes:

 1. The user tries to land the rocket manually using the control keys. 

 2. The rocket lands itself autonomously.

 3. The user competes against the rocket, trying to land as fast as possible.



Controls:

 Z - apply maximum thrust by throttling the main engine to 100%
 
 X - shut down the main engine

 Left Shift - inrease the throttle level of the main engine

 Left Control - decrease the throttle level of the main engine

 Left arrow - Use the RIGHT rcs thruster to apply a counter-clockwise moment

 Right arrow - Use the LEFT rcs thruster to apply a clockwise moment

 G - Deploy landing legs



To switch between options use the up and down arrows!



After selecting the desired game mode, the rocket/s is/are immediately spawned at the top of the screen with a random angular speed and a vertical speed of 100m/s. 

There is a limited amount of fuel so to land it safely, the burn must begin at just the right altitude, also know as the suicide burn altitude.

Also, to ensure a safe landing, the landing legs must be deployed.



Game developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04
